# Observations On Data Trends

Hopefully the visualizations show that not all days, weeks, incidents, hours,
etc are created equal.

Minors in possession of alcohol (hereafter referred to as MIPs) has to be the
favorite visualization because it is so telling. Contrary to most other
incidents, MIPs occur almost exclusively between Friday and Sunday and between
the hours of 11PM and 5AM. No other incident has such an extreme bias. Also,
Welcome Week, the week where students return to Ann Arbor for the fall
semester, is by far and away responsible for the most MIPs reported. One can
hypothesize that warm weather, no classes, and socialable nature of the week
may induce students into bold behaviors. Other weeks popular with MIP incidents
are Halloween and the week before Thanksgiving, which isn't hard to believe.



# Deviations from Trends

Note on implementation: The close observer will be quick to point out the fact
that not every year has the same number of days/weeks, and that days don't have
a set week that they occur in. The point of these graphics isn't to be
technically rigorous, but rather give general trends. The other option would be
to display all data across all years, but collapsing all the data into a single
year more easily gives rise to trend detection.
